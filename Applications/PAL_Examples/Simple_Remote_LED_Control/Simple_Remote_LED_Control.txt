PAL Example: Simple_Remote_LED_Control
======================================

This is a simple sample application demonstrating that the radio chip can receive and
transmit frames. As default the radio is in RX_ON state. When the button is
pushed, the radio goes into transmit mode and transmits one frame.
Right after transmitting, the radio goes back into listening mode. The received frames are
signalled on the LEDs.
