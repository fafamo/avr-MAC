MAC Example 2 (Indirect Traffic)


Brief Description

The basic MAC Example 2 deploys a nonbeacon-enabled network.
The coordinator starts a PAN at channel DEFAULT_CHANNEL with the PAN ID DEFAULT_PAN_ID.
The device scans for this network and associates to the coordinator.
Once the device is associated, it uses a timer that fires every 5 seconds to poll for pending data at the coordinator by means of transmitting a data request frame to the coordinator.
On the other hand every 5 seconds the coordinator queues a dummy data frame for each associated device into its indirect frame queue.
If the coordinator receives a data request frame from a particular device, it transmits the pending data frame to the device.

The results of the proper data transmission/reception are printed to a terminal program via Serial I/O (UART or USB).

For demonstration purposes the coordinator's configuration is limited to associate two devices at maximum.
