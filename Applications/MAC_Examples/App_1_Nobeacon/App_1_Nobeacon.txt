MAC Example 1


Brief Description

The basic MAC Example 1 deploys a nonbeacon-enabled network. The coordinator starts a PAN at channel DEFAULT_CHANNEL with the PAN ID DEFAULT_PAN_ID. The device scans for this network and associates to the coordinator. Once the device is associated it uses a timer that fires every 2 seconds to transmit a random payload to the coordinator.
For demonstration purposes the coordinator's configuration is limited to associate two devices at maximum.
